### Dataset Overview
#### Global Graphs
- Contains data for Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC within the `global_graph` folder:
  - `{chain}_graph_more_than_1_ratio.csv`: Contains edges where the weight—indicative of transactional or interaction metrics—exceeds 1\%. This is the same as the setting of our experiments in the paper. In this file, contracts are denoted by numerical indices rather than traditional addresses.
  - `{chain}_contract_to_number_mapping.json`:  Maps each contract's address to a numerical index utilized in the global graph files, facilitating cross-reference and analysis.

- Example code to build the global graphs for exploration:
```bash 
import networkx as nx
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(f'{chain}_graph_more_than_1_ratio.csv')
G = nx.Graph()  
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(row['Contract1'], row['Contract2'], weight=row['weight'])
```

#### Transactions
The `transactions` folder houses zipped archives with detailed transaction records for all labeled contracts within the aforementioned chains:
- `ethereum.zip`
- `polygon.zip`
- `bsc.zip`
  
Each zip file provides comprehensive transactions for tokens for the respective blockchains. The transactions for each token are stored in a CSV file named after the token's address. Each transaction include block number, sender (from), receiver (to), transaction hash, value, and timestamp.

- Example code to build the local graphs for exploration:
```bash 
import networkx as nx
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(f'{contract_address}.csv')
G = nx.Graph()  
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(row['from'], row['to'], weight=row['value'])
```

#### Labels
The `labels.csv` file categorizes each contract across different chains. It includes:
- `Chain`: Specifies the blockchain platform (e.g., ethereum, polygon, bsc).
- `Contract`: Lists the contract address or identifier.
- `Category`: Represents the category of the contract, indexed by the prevalence of contracts within that category (Category 0 contains the most contracts: fraud).

### Dataset Access and Usage
The dataset is available via [Token Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VV5ht9Eh8WGtKfkS0ipIk0FNI7g-WJfJ?usp=share_link). 

To effectively use this dataset, follow these steps:
1. Download the necessary files using the link provided above.
2. Unzip each chain's transaction archive to access individual transaction details.
3. Employ the JSON mapping files to decode contract indices within the global graphs.
4. Refer to `labels.csv` to understand the categorization of each contract, which is crucial for targeted analysis and comparative studies across different categories.

## Analyses and Experiments

### Data Analysis
Scripts for analyzing both local and global graphs are located under `analysis/`.
